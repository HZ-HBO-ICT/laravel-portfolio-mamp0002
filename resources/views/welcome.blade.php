            <h3>Why ICT Field</h3>
            <p>I tried a studies called &#x0022Toegepaste Wiskunde&#x0022 (Applied Mathematics) a few years ago, but
                it didn&#8217t work out. In the study programme were some courses related to ICT, and that really
                grabbed my attention. I have worked a year at Roompot at the Systemmanagement and Project
                department, where we had to use and maintain (from the front-end) some systems, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Maxxton Software</li>
                <li>Newyse</li>
                <li>UPTA</li>
                <li>CASman</li>
            </ul>
            I really enjoyed when we had workshops from the different companies where they showed us a quick
            overview of how they made the systems and changed things. I really liked that part more than only
            working from the front-end. This is one of the reasons that the ICT field interested me. For the
            reason why it is the best choice for me, take a look at my Blog-page.</p>

            <h3>Why an ICT studies</h3>
            <p>SO I figured out that I wanted to do something with ICT. I tried a couple online courses of
                Programming, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Visual Basic</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>Java</li>
            </ul>
            They were really interesting, but when I started the JavaScript and Java courses, things became a lot
            harder. I decided that it was better to have more support from real-life teachers that I could bother
            with my questions. That's why I chose for a full-time ICT-programme.
